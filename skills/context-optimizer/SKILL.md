  Audit and optimise context window usage for AI coding tools (Claude Code, OpenCode,
  etc.). Estimates token breakdown, identifies waste (duplicate skills,
  overlapping rules, bloated instruction files, dirty git status, MCP server overhead),
  and provides actionable recommendations with projected savings. Use when the user says
  "context checkup", "reduce context", "check context", "context audit", "how big is my
  context", or when sessions feel sluggish.

# Context optimizer

Audit the current session's context window and produce actionable recommendations to reduce waste.

## Process

### 1. Estimate token usage

Detect the active tool's config directory (`$CONFIG_DIR`) — e.g. `~/.claude/` for Claude Code,
`~/.opencode/` for OpenCode, etc. Check which directory contains the current session's config files.
Note: `CLAUDE.md` is always at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` regardless of tool. `AGENTS.md` lives in `$CONFIG_DIR`.

Read the following sources and estimate token counts (1 token ~ 4 characters / 0.75 words):

| Source | Where to find it |
| --- | --- |
| Global CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `$CONFIG_DIR/AGENTS.md` (if present) |
| Project CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md | Repo root `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (if present) |
| Skill metadata | Count skills listed in the system reminder |
| Git status snapshot | Run `git status` and measure output |
| MCP server tool definitions | `$CONFIG_DIR/mcp.json` and project `mcp.json` (if present) — each server injects tool schemas every turn |
| Conversation history | Estimate from turn count and average turn length |

Present a summary table:

```
Context usage estimate
--------------------------------------------
System prompt + tools     ~X,XXX tokens
  CLAUDE.md (global)        ~X,XXX
  AGENTS.md (global)        ~X,XXX
  CLAUDE.md (project)       ~X,XXX
  AGENTS.md (project)       ~X,XXX
  Skill metadata (N skills) ~X,XXX
  MCP tool schemas          ~X,XXX
Git status snapshot       ~X,XXX tokens
Conversation so far       ~X,XXX tokens
--------------------------------------------
Total                     ~XX,XXX tokens
```

### 2. Run checks

Run each check below. For every finding, note the estimated token saving.

#### 2a. Duplicate skills

Glob `$CONFIG_DIR/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/**/*.md`. Flag skills with overlapping
descriptions or that are aliases of the same workflow (e.g. `openspec-*` vs `opsx:*`).

#### 2b. Overlapping rules (global vs project)

Compare global files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `$CONFIG_DIR/AGENTS.md`) with project-level equivalents
(`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`). Flag rules that appear in both — these are injected twice per turn. List
each redundant section with its approximate token cost.

#### 2c. Instruction file length

If any of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `$CONFIG_DIR/AGENTS.md`, or their project-level equivalents exceeds
250 lines, recommend compressing without losing important rules. Suggest:

- Remove examples that illustrate obvious patterns (Claude already knows these)
- Collapse verbose explanations into one-liners
- Move reference-heavy sections to files loaded on demand

Explain progressive disclosure: instructions are loaded in layers — metadata always, body when
triggered, references on demand. Rules in instruction files are "always loaded", so every line costs
tokens on every turn. Content that's only needed sometimes should live in separate files loaded when
relevant (self-discovery).

#### 2d. MCP server overhead

Check `$CONFIG_DIR/mcp.json` and project-level `mcp.json` (if present) for configured servers. Each
server injects its full tool schema into context every turn.

**Security** — when reading MCP config files, never display or log credentials, tokens, API keys, or
auth headers found in server configurations. Redact sensitive values in any output shown to the user.

Flag servers whose tools overlap with:

- Built-in tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch)
- Installed skills that cover the same workflow

Recommend disabling redundant MCP servers or replacing them with lighter skills/CLI tools.

#### 2e. Git status hygiene

Run `git status --porcelain` and count entries. Flag:

- **Dirty working tree with 20+ changes** — suggest committing WIP to a feature branch
- **Stale untracked files** — `PROMPT.md` from previous session resets, temp files, build artefacts
- **Staged deletions not committed** — files removed from disk but still tracked

#### 2f. Team communication file bloat

Check for team communication files (e.g. `$CONFIG_DIR/teams/*/`) that accumulate during long
sessions. Flag files that have grown large. Skip if no team files exist.

#### 2g. SKILL.md body size / reference inlining

Scan `$CONFIG_DIR/skills/*/SKILL.md` for bodies exceeding 200 lines. Flag skills that embed detailed
reference content (schemas, long examples, lookup tables) that could be split into `references/`
files for progressive disclosure.

#### 2h. Session length check

If the conversation appears to exceed ~200k tokens (very long sessions with many turns), recommend
running `/session-reset` to preserve context and start fresh. Effectiveness degrades significantly
above 200-500k tokens.

### 3. Present recommendations

Group findings by impact (high / medium / low) based on estimated token savings. For each:

- What: the issue
- Cost: estimated tokens wasted per turn
- Fix: specific action to take
- Projected saving: tokens recovered

End with a **before/after summary**:

```
Projected savings
--------------------------------------------
Before (current)          ~XX,XXX tokens
Duplicate skills            -X,XXX
Overlapping rules           -X,XXX
MCP server overhead         -X,XXX
Git status cleanup          -X,XXX
Instruction file compression  -X,XXX
Skill body splitting        -X,XXX
--------------------------------------------
After (projected)         ~XX,XXX tokens
Saving                    ~XX,XXX tokens (XX%)
```

### 4. Offer to fix

For issues with straightforward fixes, offer to execute them:

- Stage git deletions
- Remove stale untracked files (never remove files matching sensitive patterns like `.env*`, `*.key`,
  `*.pem`, `credentials.*` — warn the user instead)
- Disable redundant MCP servers in `mcp.json` (preserve all credentials and auth config intact; only
  toggle the `disabled` flag)

Always confirm before making changes. Never delete files or modify config without explicit user approval
for each action.
